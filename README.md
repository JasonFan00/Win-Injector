# Win-Injector
A Dll injector I made using the load library approach.  Some AVs like Windows defender flagged this as a trojan while I was making it, so you might get that when compiling or running it.

A valid path to provide at the prompt would be something like:  C:/Documents/name.dll , exclude the user part and use forward slashes
